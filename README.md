# **CopyEncodedQuery**

## Description

**Wouldn't it be cool to be able to right click on the filter breadcrumb and copy a encoded gliderecord similar to copying query?**

This utility will allow you to do that and will add a additional menu similar to out of the box _'Copy Query'_ menu, to make it easily accessible.

Creating global UI script is a bad practice and I avoid creating them as much as possible. But, you can do few cool things using a global UI script that wouldn't be possible otherwise. This is one such exception for using a global UI script that you can add in your system and get a cool menu that will give you a block of encoded query.

### Installation

- Import the UI script found in [**dist**](/dist) folder.

### Usage

- I would recommend keeping this on _Development_ environment alone so that you don't run into risk of post upgrade issues or cause any other impact in case something changes in ServiceNow.
- This will only work with List-V2.
